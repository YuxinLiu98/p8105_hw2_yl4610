``` r
# load the libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
# Read and clean the data
NYCtransit_data = read_csv( "./datafiles/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
# retain certain variables
select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
# Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable
mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

This dataset contains variables such as line, station_name,
station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4,
route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry,
exit_only, vending, entrance_type, ada. I used read_csv to read the
dataset. Then I used janitor to clean names, select to include variables
that I want, and mutate to convert the character variable “entry” to
logical variable.  
It contains 20 columns and 1868 rows. These data are not tidy because
route number should be a variable instead of having 11 columns of
different routes. I should convert `route` variables from wide to long
format. In this way, it is more convenient to check on specific routes
within one column.

How many distinct stations are there?

``` r
NYCtransit_data %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 × 2
    ##    station_name             line    
    ##    <chr>                    <chr>   
    ##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue

There are 465 distinct stations.

How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
NYCtransit_data %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 84 × 2

    ## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
    ## # … with 74 more rows

84 stations are ADA compliant.

What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance?

``` r
NYCtransit_data %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

0.3770 or 37.70% station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance

``` r
